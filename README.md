# Senior Capstone Project

This is the final presentation from my year-long capstone project where I served as team lead for a group of four.

We worked with a real world stakeholder - a yacht club in Maryland - to analyze 20 years of financial data to produce a cash flow forecasting model that could predict income and expense items for future years based on a set of input parameters. Then the team evaluated and systematically assigned utility scores to a set of capital items. The cash flow forecasting model was used to estimate how much funding would be available for capital investments. This was used to produce a capital investment plan that was optimized to maximize utility subject to a budget constraint informed by the cash flow forecasting model.
